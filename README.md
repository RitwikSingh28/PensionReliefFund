## Problems Addressed:

- People, especially working in government sectors in India, depend on pension amount for living their lives once they retire.
- However, the system in our country is not so prompt to help people who are mostly aged to provide them their pension in a smooth manner.
- All this is due to the slowness introduced by human intervention. 

## Solution Proposed:

- If we could include an automated and transparent mechanism to provide people with their pension every month or instantly when they need it.
- Yes, that's possible with Blockchain technology, which is known for its transparency and secuity.
- We propose smart contract based system to deduct money from company's or government's account and storing it in smart contract.
- Part of this(eg 50%) is instamtly deposited as salary into employee's account and rest is accumulated as pension.
- After retirement, the pension will be released as some equal amounts for some time(say 30 years) to the beneficiary's account.
- Hence, we bring automation and try to solve grievances of people in getting their own earned money.
